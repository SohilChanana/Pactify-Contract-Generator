 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: June 4th 2024
 * End date: June 12th 2024

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._:

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

N/A

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
Online on Discord, every other day evening at 7pm
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
Update each other on completed work, struggles and challenges, and what we each want to try to get done by the next meeting
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.



#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?





## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.


We want a presentable version of our prototype with 2 features implemented and a login page


#### TODO-items for Product:
* Login 
* Edit account information 
* View all my previously generated contracts


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

#### Artifacts done so far for Product: 

* Create a Figma slideshow that shows the different pages and features of our website (interactive mock up).
* Create user personas that accurately demonstrate the users of the service.
* Create mock contracts to show the potential output of our service.
* Build a system design document to detail the tech stack of our project.
