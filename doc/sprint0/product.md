#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Pactify is a website that anyone can use to create an AI generated draft of a contract or agreement by providing certain information and details. Many small business owners and individuals lack the resources to hire a lawyer for drafting contracts, which can be both time-consuming and costly. Pactify addresses this issue by providing a quick, affordable, and accessible way to generate various types of contracts, such as NDAs, prenups, hiring agreements, and more. It's also perfect for creating informal agreements, like those between friends. Users will be able to create an account and choose what type of contract they need to draft. They then enter specific details about what they want included into the contract. After this, the site will output a generated contract that the user can edit and download as a PDF, ensuring that it can be shared and signed. In addition to generating new contracts, Pactify offers a feature to upload existing contract files. The AI then suggests areas that could be improved upon, ensuring that all contracts are up-to-date and compliant with current standards. Users can also view a history of the contracts they have generated, making it easy to manage and reference past agreements.

Overall, Pactify is designed to simplify the contract creation process, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their legal expertise or budget. By leveraging the power of AI, Pactify ensures that users can quickly produce high-quality contracts that meet their specific needs, providing a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users would choose Pactify because of its convenience, affordability, and speed (i.e. it’s legal ease!). Today, people are having to go to a lawyer to get a legally binding contract, or draft it on their own. Pactify is designed with those who don’t have the time or money to put together a sound contract in mind. Compared to traditional contract creation, Pactify is an infinitely more convenient option, as you can access it online with 24/7 availability, you never have to talk to another person, and it takes just minutes to get a finished contract, rather than waiting weeks or even months for a contract to be drawn up by a lawyer (since we use AI to generate a contract faster than you can say “amicus curiae”). Most importantly, Pactify is free, representing a 100% savings over getting a lawyer to write your contract.

While some other AI contract generation tools exist, they come with costs to access certain features. Many also do not let you view a history of your previously generated accounts, which can be useful if you want to revisit old documents or create several similar contracts. Pactify also presents a seamless and easy-to-use interface, making it approachable for people with no technical background.
