### 1. Do you use git flow?

Yes, we use Git Flow for managing our branches and releases! In short, Git Flow should allow us to structure our workflow and maintain a clean, organized history of our codebase. Here’s a quick overview of our branching strategy:

    Main: The main branch **ONLY** contains production-ready code. **ONLY** thoroughly tested and stable code is merged here.
    Develop: The develop branch contains the latest delivered development changes for the next release. It’s where integration of features will occur.
    Feature Branches: Feature branches are created from develop and used to work on new features. Only once the feature is complete and tested, it’s merged back into develop.

### 2. What do you name your branches?

    We will be following a clear and descriptive naming conventions for our branches to make it easier to understand the purpose of each branch. The conventions will shall be following are as follows:

    Feature Branches: 'feature/short-description'
    Release Branches: 'release/version-number'
