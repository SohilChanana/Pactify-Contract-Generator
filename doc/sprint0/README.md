Welcome to **Pactify**, a quick, easy, and affordable way to generate a contract, or update an existing contract. With our AI-powered contract generation, users can choose from one of our predefined templates or upload their own PDF, give us some additional information, and **Pactify** will do the rest. After generating your contract, you can freely edit, download, share, and save your contract to your account.
